## ToDo

## Features remaining


* grab out every function differently 
* remove struct stmt?
* type check struct declarations?
* fix macros that are functions, aka sizeof

* return struct without pointer?
    * essentially leave it on the stack afterwards

## Bugs
### Compiler
* do a walkthrough of legit everything and do refactors
* don't label else if there isn't any :)


### Parser
* allow Foo * foo and a * b
* do actual proper error handling while parsing, and figure out what to do with exceptions


### Showcases
Snake X11
