* do actual proper error handling while parsing, and figure out what to do with exceptions
* includes

## Compiler
* fix a check whether a function has returned or not?
* get signatures prior to compiling functions?
* we don't catch mismatched arg size?
* which registers do we need to grab after a condition check
