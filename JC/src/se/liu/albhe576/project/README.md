## ToDo

## Features remaining


* test bitwise
* index array of structs?
* actually use error function
* fix macros that are functions, aka sizeof
* return struct without pointer?
  * essentially leave it on the stack afterwards
* don't label else if there isn't any :)
* be able to declare empty functions




## Bugs
### Compiler
* do a walkthrough of legit everything and do refactors


### Parser
* do actual proper error handling while parsing, and figure out what to do with exceptions


### Showcases
Snake X11
